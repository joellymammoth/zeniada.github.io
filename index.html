                        <h2>Hillside</h2>
                        <h4>Alan Fang</h4><br>

She makes art, makes skylines, wills them to drop and tumble<br />
and to scale and rise, all with the cautious flick of the wrist.<br />
She makes the Charm City circulate, revolving through <br />
black tar arterials, and the rows of harbor boats glide across the <br />
placid, adulterated water, to and fro, in place of the waves.<br />
And I, made aware of this human condition, saw<br />
Men wearing homeopathic machine gun rounds <br />
around their necks, like back in Normandy and Nam’<br />
Wearing wooden crosses across their chests<br />
or gold plated starry nights on alloy chains<br />
<br />
and wearing themselves out, travelling hours for the sole sake <br />
of the view from the city’s all natural peak, from Federal Hill,<br />
Out from its underbelly, the faded pastel colors and shades <br />
of the brick face seen from the stoops and alley streets and <br />
Here was where I wanted to watch my brain matter be scattered <br />
over the asphalt, as Bavarian flower girls marked their territory<br />
with tender flicks of their wrists, leaving serene <br />
Flutters of pink gray petals, that carried in the wind <br />
Gas and steam, vapors hallucinate, ready to escape from this<br />
Earth and into the atmosphere, beyond—beyond.<br />
<br />
She makes the city oscillate at her feet, and as well, me, <br />
and I acutely understood every feeling that overloaded my<br />
Sunbaked brain, over and over, were words like <br />
god help me, punish me no longer, let me live,<br />
Until I lost the orientation of the rage in my soles and <br />
I had visions of my feminine hands and fingers and <br />
Drunken self and wished for nothing more than to <br />
Become colorless and rigid and to love this frustration <br />
and never again wonder why.<br />
<br />

                        <h4>Allison Jiang</h4><br>

This is a poem for Peaky Blinders-era Cillian Murphy, the enigmatic,<br>
sooty, violent, and soft-hearted man of my dreams-<br>
he puts on his shirt and then his waistcoat and then his vest and then<br>
another waistcoat and he smokes cigarettes and loves women.<br>
Like really loves them<br>
like they did in the old days but then I remember that<br>
Peaky Blinders-era Cillian Murphy’s hair is soft and brown<br>
under his pageboy hat and that<br>
he only uses Chinese girls for their sham red-powder mysticism and<br>
sometimes I forget that everything about me is sharp and pointed and<br>
I forget myself and I forget to make my voice soft and round so that they know<br>
that I can be like them, too.<br>
I look down at my hands to make sure they look like they could hold<br>
a gun in post-Great War Birmingham and to make sure they look<br>
like Cillian Murphy’s could (realistically) help them hold it.<br>
Sometimes I wonder how it’s possible for me to feel this way and for them<br>
to think that I don’t feel this way and to think<br>
I don’t feel this way because my black hair and my spacious eyelids<br>
are things that make people not feel things.<br>
Cillian Murphy has spaces between the blue part of his eye<br>
and the top part<br>
spaces that are there<br>
all the time and<br>
he doesn’t realize that girls like me dream of living in them; dream<br>
of being more than<br>
what we are; long to lie down on that beautiful robins-egg<br>
icy electric slate gray<br>
Midwestern midwinter<br>
“ethereal...alluring to a camera” -Vogue Magazine<br>
round as fuck blue ground and look up at a white sky<br>
that goes on forever.<br>
I know I will never be the red-powder explosion<br>
in a beautiful gangster’s grey world-<br>
and when I watch Peaky Blinders-era Cillian Murphy<br>
punch somebody with a razor in slow-motion I feel like<br>
seven-eighths of a person and I’m sure that if he were to love me I would feel<br>
seven-eighths loved and if the writers had us hook up somehow I would be allowed<br>
seven-eighths of good time<br>
because it’s just different somehow.<br>
The episode always ends and I always<br>
see my reflection in the blank black and that’s<br>
why I’m like what I’m like.<br>
Does that make sense<br>
to anyone else?<br>
<br>
