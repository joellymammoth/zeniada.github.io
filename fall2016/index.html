						She makes art, makes skylines, wills them to drop and tumble<br />
                        and to scale and rise, all with the cautious flick of the wrist.<br />
                        She makes the Charm City circulate, revolving through <br />
                        black tar arterials, and the rows of harbor boats glide across the <br />
                        placid, adulterated water, to and fro, in place of the waves.<br />
                        And I, made aware of this human condition, saw<br />
                        Men wearing homeopathic machine gun rounds <br />
                        around their necks, like back in Normandy and Nam’<br />
                        Wearing wooden crosses across their chests<br />
                        or gold plated starry nights on alloy chains<br />
                        <br />
                        and wearing themselves out, travelling hours for the sole sake <br />
                        of the view from the city’s all natural peak, from Federal Hill,<br />
                        Out from its underbelly, the faded pastel colors and shades <br />
                        of the brick face seen from the stoops and alley streets and <br />
                        Here was where I wanted to watch my brain matter be scattered <br />
                        over the asphalt, as Bavarian flower girls marked their territory<br />
                        with tender flicks of their wrists, leaving serene <br />
                        Flutters of pink gray petals, that carried in the wind <br />
                        Gas and steam, vapors hallucinate, ready to escape from this<br />
                        Earth and into the atmosphere, beyond—beyond.<br />
                        <br />
                        She makes the city oscillate at her feet, and as well, me, <br />
                        and I acutely understood every feeling that overloaded my<br />
                        Sunbaked brain, over and over, were words like <br />
                        god help me, punish me no longer, let me live,<br />
                        Until I lost the orientation of the rage in my soles and <br />
                        I had visions of my feminine hands and fingers and <br />
                        Drunken self and wished for nothing more than to <br />
                        Become colorless and rigid and to love this frustration <br />
                        and never again wonder why.

                        This is a poem for Peaky Blinders-era Cillian Murphy, the enigmatic,<br>
                        sooty, violent, and soft-hearted man of my dreams-<br>
                        he puts on his shirt and then his waistcoat and then his vest and then<br>
                        another waistcoat and he smokes cigarettes and loves women.<br>
                        Like really loves them<br>
                        like they did in the old days but then I remember that<br>
                        Peaky Blinders-era Cillian Murphy’s hair is soft and brown<br>
                        under his pageboy hat and that<br>
                        he only uses Chinese girls for their sham red-powder mysticism and<br>
                        sometimes I forget that everything about me is sharp and pointed and<br>
                        I forget myself and I forget to make my voice soft and round so that they know<br>
                        that I can be like them, too.<br>
                        I look down at my hands to make sure they look like they could hold<br>
                        a gun in post-Great War Birmingham and to make sure they look<br>
                        like Cillian Murphy’s could (realistically) help them hold it.<br>
                        Sometimes I wonder how it’s possible for me to feel this way and for them<br>
                        to think that I don’t feel this way and to think<br>
                        I don’t feel this way because my black hair and my spacious eyelids<br>
                        are things that make people not feel things.<br>
                        Cillian Murphy has spaces between the blue part of his eye<br>
                        and the top part<br>
                        spaces that are there<br>
                        all the time and<br>
                        he doesn’t realize that girls like me dream of living in them; dream<br>
                        of being more than<br>
                        what we are; long to lie down on that beautiful robins-egg<br>
                        icy electric slate gray<br>
                        Midwestern midwinter<br>
                        “ethereal...alluring to a camera” -Vogue Magazine<br>
                        round as fuck blue ground and look up at a white sky<br>
                        that goes on forever.<br>
                        I know I will never be the red-powder explosion<br>
                        in a beautiful gangster’s grey world-<br>
                        and when I watch Peaky Blinders-era Cillian Murphy<br>
                        punch somebody with a razor in slow-motion I feel like<br>
                        seven-eighths of a person and I’m sure that if he were to love me I would feel<br>
                        seven-eighths loved and if the writers had us hook up somehow I would be allowed<br>
                        seven-eighths of good time<br>
                        because it’s just different somehow.<br>
                        The episode always ends and I always<br>
                        see my reflection in the blank black and that’s<br>
                        why I’m like what I’m like.<br>
                        Does that make sense<br>
                        to anyone else?

                        The hands I have belong to my father,<br>
                        and fathers before him who carved their lives<br>
                        out of porcelain, fragile like the daughters<br>
                        they forged into sons so they could survive.<br>
                        So in my rough palms flow smooth lines, scratching<br>
                        numbers into cracked bones, words on dry skin–<br>
                        sensations to hide behind while searching<br>
                        for the perfect path to comfortable content.<br>

                        doctrine internalized, breeding disdain.<br>

                        minding the gap. Even at night, white<br>
                        hardhats can be seen lining the silo rims:<br>
                        <br>
                        try winning the lottery, and know cancer.<br> 
                        From the window-side, Point-No-Point:<br>
                        Rohm and Haas hired teenagers that grew up to be caterers<br>
                        driving drunk through the Thanksgiving Day Parade,<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying: <i>this isn’t how it used to be</i>.<br>
                        Point-No-Point is Imaginary Country:<br>
                        <i>no wider than a ploughshare, and as strait as an arrow</i>,<br>
                        it appears to be a point, and then you close<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in on it, and it becomes an ordinary cape,<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then again, rowing closer to it,<br>
                        <br>
                        it’s gone. I’ve felt my misgivings in train vestibules,<br>
                        important failures––<i>and the farmer continued to plow</i>––<br>
                        others played a role and have yet to be held.

                    <p>
                        I made a list of all the things that you love and I tentatively decided to place myself at the very end <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because I’m a narcissist, too much in my own mind<br>
                        Storm clouds roll in, yet the sun perches itself upon my shoulder and tells me lies about the imminent<br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;summer and about the ghost that I am and about Manhattan ready to burst under the weight of<br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its homeless hearts<br>
                        Storm clouds roll in, still the sun caresses the back of my neck, feels out the crevices, every vertebra<br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and draws figure eights I’ll never see<br>
                        The wind rises and the shower head, O Mother have mercy for I who arose from your earthen soil roots<br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my atoms are your own my bones my flesh all yours they are<br> 
                        I want to be celestial– angelic like all the lesbians every weekend, puffing on marijuana fags to feel that<br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dull dull electric<br>
                        I want Heaven to wander down, stroke my cheek, read me Naked Lunch all in a dulcet monotone I<br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dream to be as undisciplined, to live those vignettes the way they play out in my mind<br>
                        Forget adolescence and chastity and propriety and your good holy nature, god let me live, Mother let<br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me forget the tempest that stalks in my wake<br>
                        Remember youth among the American elm and the spastic joy and Samuel’s cradle and all of the<br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hormones and purgatoried nights that built up to this very moment<br>
                        Remember me going to war for you clutching a lodestone and a gun barrel in each of my pink baby soft<br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;palms, trudging to the asphalt trenches to carve out new scars on my knees<br>
                        Nights I spent discussing realpolitik with chapped lips and labias and twelve angry jurors and whatever<br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commie delusion spell I swear I was under<br>
                        Mornings wherein my eyes melted out of their sockets over washed out printer paper photographs of<br>  
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hudson river and mister rogers and balding jewesses<br>
                        Mornings that devolved into ballroom dancing wearing nothing but my own holy good nature muttering<br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disembodied sacraments and manuscripts<br>
                        The stuffs of legend and floodlights and art household movie dealings and cannon bard epics and<br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tokyo tower of babel &amp; all at once<br>
                        Please forgive that which exists among the red threaded morbid sex-crazed dramatics that<br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;live only in swamp new jersey theater companies<br>
                        But more than anything to understand the human heart, that which could be attained sequestered behind<br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chinese immigrant registers, the knowledge of aging &amp; peeling oriental wallpapers, the secrets of<br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fortune cookie vats, the mass produced cellophane &amp; sugar wafers, the wisdom of black marbled<br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tabletops who unwittingly eavesdropped on the hushed confessionals dancing over steam noodle 
                        soup<br>
                        Chinatown nook cranny and crack and jazz and math, the hints of universe and god and prophet and<br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;side-a-ways glances and the modern era erotics<br>
                        Of colossal brown grim dark irises and bedroom innocence wraths and arteries of all sorts, faux<br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mescaline manias and impulsive grunts wasting brain matter and cash<br>
                        And above all the disappointment, the only explanation for your limp dick diathesis and yellow fever and<br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mallon-esque facial structures<br>
                        And above all that pre-bolshevik showroom mantelpiece magnum that emancipates me through all of my<br>

                        Allison Jiang is scared most of the time but has learned<br>
                        how to squeeze that fear into a ball and make it bounce; she has learned how to stand so that her hair curls right and cry so that plants grow right and live so that she is scared 
                        but is still ok.<br>
                        Allison Jiang has accepted that things may never be good, but after some time in front of the bathroom mirror,<br>
                        they might be enticed into being ok.<br>
                        Allison Jiang is a movie with a cheesy message,<br> 
                        a spoon when you need a fork,<br>
                        a force of black-haired-girl magic and driving slowly that is ready<br>
                        to finally be known.<br>

                        Black-haired-girl magic is what I discovered far too late<br> 
                        for any of that mess in junior year;<br> 
                        black-haired girls you see they’re smooth. Smooth in the way that we were built to love,<br>
                        smooth in the way that takes you back to a time when the moon was a lot bigger<br>
                        than it is now.<br>
                        I used to want to hide my face inside so that no one would be able to tell<br>
                        that I loved it, loved everything about my almond joy-eyes because I didn’t want them to see me<br> 
                        thinking that this was beautiful.<br> 
                        I was afraid that if they looked me in the eye they would find the secret stash of confidence of beauty that I hid between my pupil and my iris,<br> 
                        that they would find it and think<br>
                        it was funny; but now I show it to them before they can laugh<br>
                        and I wear the irony of my eyes<br>
                        like a pair of comfy shoes, and I feel<br> 
                        that black-haired-girl magic flow behind me like an ink trail, like my hair and I feel<br>
                        bits of the stars from way way down in my blood and I feel<br>
                        like I’m sitting on a mountain high high above the clouds where I can see<br>
                        that we can be loved after all.
