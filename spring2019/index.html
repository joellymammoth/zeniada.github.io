					<h2>Waterways</h2>
					<p style="color:#2C2C2C;">
					Wavering headlights<br>
					and you: the driver, deer, and<br>
					aftermath. And you:<br>
					<br>

					haloed and looking<br>
					away and away in the<br>
					high beam brightness. High<br>
					<br>

					way past the lake. Past<br>
					the power station. Past the<br>
					side road home. High school<br>
					<br>

					teacher passes us<br>
					in her vehicle and for<br>
					a moment we are<br>
					<br>

					people that we don’t<br>
					know anymore. You brake. The<br>
					bridge rocks beneath the<br>
					<br>

					wheels, against the warm<br>
					underbelly of the car.<br>
					You pretend to steer,<br>
					<br>

					but we both know that<br>
					we’re going wherever the<br>
					water wants us to.<br>

					</p>
					<br><br>


					<h2>Mother</h2>
					<p style="color:#2C2C2C;">
					Said we buried the fish here.<br>
					It looked more rock than animal:<br>
					<br>
					something misplaced. Something<br>
					slow-earth washing away to rain.<br>
					<br>
					There’s a sinkhole now: mouth marking<br>
					where the water wanted its own back.<br>
					<br>
					We couldn’t oblige, of course, couldn’t ask <br>
					mother which plant was growing tall from decay.<br>
					<br>
					(Fireweed, glasswort, self-heal, trembling<br>
					aspen, cattail, goatsbeard, oxeye daisy?)<br>
					<br>
					Instead, we carried the riverbank home<br> 
					and watched its lifeblood lap closer<br>
					<br>
					and closer to our feet. We heard the water<br>
					promise that one day, we would be hers.<br>
					<br>
					We would be hers and know<br>
					the true mother of life.<br>

					<h2>To a Boy I've Never Met Before</h2>
					<p style="color:#2C2C2C;">
					At night, I count the squalls of sirens, and do not think of
					who has called the ambulance, do not think of who is dying,
					do not think of heart attacks and palms cut open with
					blades and blood on linoleum. I think of you, and what you
					called me, how it cut me open.<br>
					Cunt.<br>
					The worst word you can think of is the place that you came
					from.
					That blessed searing bastard thing, a thousand ships gone,
					and you still can’t help but hate it.
					73 dollars on vodka cranberries and still it’s out of reach,
					<i>waste of time, don’t want it anyway,</i> 4 a.m. can’t help but
					hate it.<br>
					Cunt.<br>
					Not to my face, I wasn’t there, but I bet the boys beside
					you laughed and I bet you felt good about it.
					I don’t fll spaces like you think I should. I kissed too many
					of your brothers and loved too few, so <i>fuck her, she’s crazy,
					don’t want it anyway, </i>laugh like you mean it, like it might
					stop the rage, like it might save you.<br>
					Cunt.<br>
					I’d like to say I wore that pink coat of arms like a soldier
					and burned alive like Joan of Arc and stood with shoulders
					back, carved the letters in my fesh and wore the word like
					a new tattoo.<br>
					But at night, I do not think of ambulances. I count the
					sirens, count the shadows on the ceiling, count the bare-
					chested boys, count the bleeding cuts and the beats of my
					heart. There is a soft pulse between my legs, and it seems
					to speak, it says, <i>I am, I am, I am.</i>

					shifting orange peels and egg shells aside.<br>
					I knew we seemed harmless to them, because<br>

					as though we could not use our hands<br>
					to strain out the essential knowledge<br>
