					Then he showed us the machine<br>
					that could separate, by density, the good oil<br>
					from the other parts that had made their way into the mix<br>
					somewhere along the thick knit of pipe<br> 
					that traced its way through the onshore refinery.<br> 
					It was unlike the other machines, smaller<br>
					yet heavy in its construction, years of rust<br> 
					built up on the exterior, the carbon-steel chamber<br> 
					completely sealed from the outside.<br> 
					It looked like a slow cooker<br>
					but the mechanic knew better, and with a clamp<br>
					and a switch he sent the contents spinning<br> 
					with measured, careful force. He let us step around it,<br>
					so we did, and we thought maybe from this angle<br>  
					we could catch some of its secrets: the dark,<br> 
					chemical kind that would tell us something<br> 
					about ourselves, how we could mingle at times<br>
					yet also fly apart. But through<br> 
					the whole process, the machine kept<br> 
					shut, just like it was supposed to, its hum<br> 
					increasing with steady intensity until it found<br>
					the right pitch, somehow revealing nothing<br>  
					about the in-between, though I can always<br>
					imagine: a slurry of slick fluid, thrown<br> 
					against the walls of the hollow cylinder like children<br>
					at the carnival, strapped vertically into the slots<br>
					of the Gravitron, spinning, all facing inward—<br>
					like the earth, with its people<br> 
					only at the edges, revolving around<br> 
					a predetermined center, comfortable this way,<br> 
					where, because of some invisible pull,<br>
					we are all held neatly into place.

					<h2>in enemy (vulnerable) territory: reflections on intimacy
					<!--span>Katerina Pavlidis</span--></h2>

					<p style="color:#2C2C2C;">
						beauty is in the neurosis of the beholder<br>
						honey is in the palm of the bee holder<br>
						honey, you’ve got me in the palm of your hand
					</p>

					<br><p>=</p><br>

					<p style="color:#2C2C2C;">
						I love our wet drum<br>
						with its many parts:<br><br>

						slaps like cymbals<br>
						snarls like snare<br><br>

						rolling sighs<br>
						between my thighs<br><br>

						what’s that, demise?<br>
						in your <i>selva</i> eyes
					</p>

					<br><p>=</p><br>

					<p style="color:#2C2C2C;">
						thick current of love power<br>
						surges through my node-joints and wire-nerves<br> 
						up into my rod-bones and satellite-dish-skull<br><br>

						signals swirl, echo<br>
						ring like wine in a glass<br><br>

						my love power comes from the bounce that lives<br>
						in the balls of my greek feet, second toe longest<br>

					</p>

					<br><p>=</p><br>

					<p style="color:#2C2C2C;">
						what do you do when you’re all alone in the world?<br> 
						and what do you do when you’re leaning to the right on your own left<br> shoulder crying in the shower, one big wet knot?<br> 
						and what do you do when you’ve let the wrong person live inside of you for too long?
					</p>

					<br><p>=</p><br>

					<p style="color:#2C2C2C;">
						It wasn’t you who taught me how to dance of course.<br>
						this has lived in me since I arrived here,<br>
						sometimes I forget I existed before&emsp;<i>you</i>
					</p>

					<br><p>=</p><br>

					<p style="color:#2C2C2C;">
						first you drink ten loaves of bread worth of beer with your fellow heartbrokens, because you hate beer, because you want to feel gross of your own accord, because you don’t care about yourself. you just realized you haven’t cared for yourself in a long time.
					</p>

					<br><p>=</p><br>

					<p style="color:#2C2C2C;">
						i deleted twitter but i still compose tweets in my head<br><br>

						i pulled you out of me but you’re still there when i need you<br>
						have you even left yet, or did you just become quiet suddenly? like someone who’s been caught?<br><br>

						i did just find you out, after all.<br>
						you were right under my nose, resting on the hairs of my upper lip<br><br>

						you know, the dark ones you tease me about.<br>
						the ones you tug at with your teeth<br>
						the ones you tickle when i’m asleep
					</p>

					<br><p>=</p><br>

					<p style="color:#2C2C2C;">
						here, i have made my home in this terrible no-man’s land<br>
						in enemy (vulnerable) territory—<br>
						stuck past the verge of tears—<br>
						i am no soldier, just a lost gun<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cold and wet
					</p>

					<br><p>=</p><br>

					<p style="color:#2C2C2C;">
						then you put your nice heels on and your sexy green shirt over that handmedown bra that’s too big because sometimes it’s fun to dress up like a girl. and when people get scared by that radiant aura you just can’t turn off no matter how hard you try, you take a long walk through dark alleys with those heels because everyone’s always told you not to. you don’t care about yourself, you haven’t cared for yourself in a long time. but don’t worry about what will happen. you’ll start caring about yourself again soon. you’ll run into some kitties and some lonely restaurant owners, that’s all. and you’ll get your sexy green shirt sweaty for nothing, that’s all.
					</p>

					<br><p>=</p><br>

					<p style="color:#2C2C2C;">
						Your presence does to me what wine does to my mother. It makes me grin and tell stories I’m too scared to remember around anyone else.<br><br>

						Sometimes I face my bare feet toward the clouds just so I can feel the blood rush into my toes when I rise,<br><br>

						when I rise<br>
						do<br>
						not<br>
						fear
					</p>

					<br><p>=</p><br>

					<p style="color:#2C2C2C;">
						write a poem for every round that’s in your chamber.<br><br>

						it’s not your fault. <i>say it again.</i><br> 
						it’s not our fault they turned us into guns.<br><br><br>


						WE ALL MISS FIRE<br><br>

						MX. FIRE, ME

					All of the flowers are dead now<br>
					Mama said.<br><br>

					Lavender buds;<br>
					the dried purple rises in its flesh, crack<br>
					as the heads, crushed, in my fingers wait,<br>
					throb for water.<br><br>

					I like my sandpaper hands,<br>
					when the breeze hides in the trees—<br><br>

					so you see, so you see<br>
					I’m okay. The headache— headaches,<br>
					just won’t go away.<br><br>

					That’s the reason for five, six, seven days off school<br>
					I say to my friends<br><br>

					All of the flowers are dead.

						And besides I always think better<br>
						when crickets make that sound<br> 
						and this time I<br> 
						thought better about Lucas<br>
						so I wasn't thinking about any of that other stuff<br>
						I just thought<br> 
						about football and how<br> 
						good he used to be<br>  
						at football<br> 
						and about this catch he made in the quarterfinals<br> 
						and how his left arm extended over that safety's right shoulder<br> 
						and how he looked<br> 
						like a superhero or something<br>
						like the best we'd ever seen<br>
						but then I had to take a piss<br>  
						so I stood up<br> 
						and brushed the dirt off my clothes<br> 
						and walked behind this one tree because<br>
						it was the ugliest or something<br> 
						and I unzipped my jeans<br> 
						and the piss came out fast<br> 
						which is how it normally comes out<br> 
						when you drink<br>
						and I could see the ants<br> 
						climbing up the bark<br> 
						and I pretended I was God making it rain on them.
