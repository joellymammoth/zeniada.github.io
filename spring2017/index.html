						The world was erected by God or a bomb made of water.<br>
                        A fish, some kind of human sized thing.<br>
                        The Earth took shape and manners followed time<br>
                        with suits and housewives.<br>
                        <br>
                        College and marriage <br>
                        for book clubs and Jesus.<br>
                        Our ancestors labored so that we may<br>
                        serve tea in an effort to be <br>
                        remembered, things<br>
                        forgotten.<br>
                        <br>
                        What was once the Devil’s music <br>
                        has been made into furniture <br>
                        for a Dentist’s on Butternut Lane. <br>
                        <br>
                        When the sky fell on the first day<br>
                        of the first year,<br>
                        I was in my pajamas,<br>
                        in quite a state because the sun was shining<br>
                        too brightly<br>
                        and my future kids can’t read.<br>

					<h2>Daddy</h2>
					<p>
						My father washes his hands with orchid petals and mist water. He dries, then wets them again to make emeralds out of oil in his eyes.<br> 
                        He sits and draws with pen what he can’t write in the newspaper and turns a blind eye as four blessings grow more tired with age—two women makes a lonely life. <br>
                        There’s humor in subtlety and also in picking me up three and a half minutes late at summer camp. <br>
                        He smells marijuana and hears sobbing louder than mother ever could. At night, he climbs the stairs slowly and with audible pain. <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thump. thump. thump. relief.<br>
                        He turns a blind eye of emerald and oil and washes his hands: orchid petals and mist water. <br>
                        I can hear the bathroom water run from my bedroom. A necklace mother dropped running away from the problem hangs from my fingers like rosary beads. <br>
                        He opens the door slowly, not wanting to disturb the geography of anything. <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creak. cut. click. relief. <br>
                        Dinner is so cold he talks mostly to himself, the voice ashen and gravel. <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I hate this smell—too sweet”<br>
                        The breath is stolen from my lungs; every effort is to say sorry.<br>
                         I can’t love him in the eyes. <br>
                        The phone doesn’t ring to tell me he’s died.<br>

						he was like the shell fixed by a parchment membrane, broken and unbroken. <br>
                        <br>

                        (hollow hearts became less heavy in the twilight morning and I became the ghost of what is no longer. )<br>
                        <br>

                        salt rises from the ocean wedged in his belly, the thought stretched like a tidal bulge between the open periwinkle cabinet door and his stinging ski-slope nose. <br>
                        <br>

                        (i once carried a hundred pounds of salt in my stomach.)<br>
                        <br>

                        there is something primal about the lines that look like cracked continents on the pasty shell of an unready chick before it hits his lips. once he said he loved the grit in messy things. the enviable moonlight filled the crevices that are miles deep between the pusillanimous secrets unhidden on his wrinkled, youthful brow. <br>
                        <br>

                        (i once scraped at those stopping places.)<br>
                        <br>

                        in spite of his love for arid, barren things his favorite place to stand is over the steaming hot water gushing from the achy faucet into the tin kitchen sink. he liked the way the rising steam settled his fidgeting mind and the soothing rhythm of the rushing water pulsed underneath him.<br>
                        <br>

                        (i now know that only lonely, hot hearts are found in transmitted blue hues eating hard boiled eggs before the sun rises.)<br>
                        <br>

                        in the blue kitchen light, deflated dreams dissolve into the consistency of a creamy waning gibbous moon, awkward and unreachable. Four hardboiled eggs in hand, he spins them on the counter like a distant deaf DJ. the crunch of the shell pressed against the white ceramic plate shatters the silent hum of this premature morning crisis.<br>

						I used to think I would become a writer but now<br>
                        my words feel rusty at the joints;<br>
                        they scuttle awkwardly from my fingers, not as smooth<br>
                        as I remember them being,<br>
                        not nearly as beautiful.<br>
                        In the room downstairs where the Christmas tree used to be I see an image of myself,<br>
                        bowl-haired and <br>
                        not yet scared, playing with dolls I didn’t yet know<br>
                        didn’t look like me.<br>
                        Through the slats in the bannister I was able to see<br>
                        my mother videotaping me and I didn’t even care.<br>
                        I lived there during a time when girls were best friends with their next-door neighbors<br>
                        and no one had really told me<br>
						how I was supposed to feel.<br>
                        I climb the carpeted stairs now and I am reminded<br>
                        of trips to the beach that felt like forever;<br>
                        I would run into the ocean because I knew I would be knocked down by the waves. <br>
                        The unfathomable force of the universe <br>
                        made me laugh so hard. I didn’t know then that I would grow to fear the feeling <br>
                        of <i>not</i> feeling<br>
                        sand under my feet and I didn’t know then <br>
                        that the next time I waded into the ocean<br>
                        I would be wearing denim cutoff shorts and thinking <br>
                        about a boy with blond hair; when I lived at 7 Hawthorne Drive I didn’t yet know <br>
                        what would come to be<br>
						of the world’s roundness and my sharpness;<br>
						the tiny hands of my wisdom;<br>
						how things always come full circle<br>
						but never in a way that makes sense.<br>

                        a glitter on our back patio.<br>
                        <br>
                        I felt the breath go — but do they breathe?<br>
                        — gnawing at my inner cheek like hook<br>
                        through fish in Solomon's Island<br>
                        our skin so gently peeling in the sun<br>
                        as if painted, as if hollow<br>
                        geography of loose lawn mower parts<br>
                        spread out for our father to reassemble.<br>
                        <br>
                        Do these rudimentary things have minds<br>
                        that they might think about their deaths<br>
                        with some sense of fear or hunger?<br>
                        or in their ignorance are they brave<br>
                        <br>
                        like also that day at the Bay when<br>
                        you took my hand and stretched me toward<br>
                        the open mouth of water, pushed my head below<br>
                        the surface as if loving and violating<br>
                        are one and the same,<br>
                        <br>
                        wanting — I could feel in your fingers tightened around<br>
                        my neck, that wanting — to tell me a secret<br>
                        on the car ride home. But also not worrying<br>
                        if my head would never come to lap the water,<br>
                        my bulbous eyes gradually relaxing<br>
                        in their sodden sockets,<br>
                        my body growing limp to the water<br>
                        malignant and curved like a worm<br>
                        away from wind and air<br>
                        <br>
                        and staying there.<br>
