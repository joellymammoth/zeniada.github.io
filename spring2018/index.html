					I. Mint Plant (Provides mint)<br><br>

					The mint plant rests on tiles near the gutter.<br>
					Leathery leaves crinkle to her touch, she sifts,<br>
					Looking for a mature leaf to pull from stem.<br>
					The crickets swell, pinecones clamp shut<br>
					In anticipation for an early-morning drizzle.<br><br><br>

					II. Puri ("Poori")<br><br>

					Cracked nails meet frying oil, somehow<br>
					No spatula needed, she flips the puri—<br>
					Dough thins and crisps in a speckled bowl<br>
					Rises to form air-filled pocket, plucked <br>
					To cool on a sloppy roll of parchment.<br><br><br>

					III. Chai ("Chah")<br><br>

					She thumbs through the spice rack—<br>
					Turmeric, cardamom, saffron, to find chai.<br>
					Tin cracks open, two tablespoons blends<br>
					With milk and sugar, mint leaves rest atop<br>
					A film, soon pinched from steaming mug.<br><br><br>

					IV. Ghee (Butter)<br><br>

					Stirrings in the house, she heats the ghee.<br>
					Bubbles coalesce in pots, a half-sphere spoon<br>
					Spreads a layer of glaze across a disk of bread.<br>
					Sugar sprinkled, placemats set, enter family.<br>
					She goes to pray.<br><br><br>

					V. Temple (In-home)<br><br>

					Incense clipped to sandalwood tray burns lazy,<br>
					Bhajans moan through scented air, cotton wicks blaze<br>
					In make-shift candle perched on silver tray.<br>
					Eyes closed, beads are wrung and lips quiver.<br>
					Broken glass down the hall, but now she’s serving God.

				let me be a swallow<br>
				in southern Spain while<br>
				drinking on the wing<br>
				and roosting in a red barn<br>
				of someone's grandparents.<br><br>

				I made a list when I was little,<br>
				but if I only have one day let me whisper<br>
				to the whales to stay under during the eclipse.<br>
				I can join them maybe and become<br>
				a flying fish who leaps into the eighth sea.<br>
				My scales catch fire and I am<br>
				a casque-headed lizard dubbed worthy by Him.<br><br>

				Give me perfect vision, so I can be<br>
				an astronaut and spin the earth back years.<br>
				I'll spy on others sleeping and listen to<br>
				the breath and plant dreams<br>
				in their nightlights.<br><br>

				For just one day let me write<br>
				the perfect poem with words<br>
				like peacock ennui or galaxies<br>
				of dust in light.<br>
				Let me hold some color<br>
				when I go,<br>
				and the next<br>
				breakfast I will<br>
				still be.<br><br>

				The river severs the chapel into two halves<br>
				with rapids of silver knives. When the sun goes<br>
				down, the riverbed bleeds. On one side,<br>
				a steam engine runs around toy tracks, the other<br>
				is grandmother’s quilt, the one I used to use<br>
				to bury myself. It is warm underground.<br> 
				Speciation depends upon isolation.<br><br>

				In the river there are fish,<br>
				scales falling upward like rain until<br>
				the surface of the water glitters. I<br>
				can see my reflection; I cannot recognize<br>
				the fish, cannot name them in Latin, in<br>
				vernacular, in love. Suddenly, water<br>
				is strange to me and tastes metallic.<br> 
				The air is white with ash and<br>
				the air does not contain your breath.<br> 
				I choke. The world hurricanes.<br><br> 

				I am severed from you by something<br> 
				like a hurricane. When Darwin’s finches<br> 
				were blown away to the island, they evolved<br> 
				into artifacts. Miles of sagebrush<br> 
				and scrap metal and barns falling<br> 
				in on themselves. Distance as<br> 
				panorama. Body as diorama. You<br> 
				are a porcelain figurine<br> 
				in the center. You wear white.<br> 
				My body is a house where I no longer<br>
				live, genetic history that I carry with me.<br><br>

				I speciate. I river. I am transitive<br>
				and transitory but I still<br> 
				have a mouth. I am not the same<br> 
				as I used to be. When you stand<br>
				on the rock ledge and look<br> 
				into me, do not hesitate<br>
				to jump. I will hold you suspended,<br>
				even when the water runs cold.

				Cream patisserie, rushes in from all<br>

				Connecticut. Then, to gather again strings<br>
				Between window seams: the cool air of<br>
				Beginnings or in fact, steady icicles<br>
				Drooping lazily and with little effort.<br>
				I told you before that this was an escape<br>
				From one frozen place to the other—<br>
				The climate: similar but more damp<br>
				And often bitter, though the summers<br>
				Are considered "pleasant." We move<br>
				East and west and repeat repressed traditions.<br>
				Was it a sister or friend, at a time when<br>
				Everything else mattered? My grandmother<br>
				Was Russian back when tsars were Russian.<br>

				I turn the page and read as a girl with long blonde hair<br>
				sings about femininity,<br>
				clicking of the clocking blurring in the background as<br>
				a line raises my hand for the bathroom.<br><br>

				Empty stalls and a reflection hear me say:<br>
				<i>I'm no more a woman than Christ was a man</i><br>

				I snuck in my pocket,<br>

				I &emsp;walked with a mug of tea for the last threads of Sunday’s sun. A kid directs some parallel parking in stern Japanese. In the next space is a white Honda civic with a bottle of champagne in the cup holder. Beyond that the ATM is temporarily out of service. The laminated carpet that was a squirrel shifts in the wind, pink-gingham-shirted waiter leaving work winds around to inspect the corpse and guffaws.<br> 
				I &emsp;sat down in the skate park but had to stub out a cigarette when a little girl came over to me<br>
				and scrambled the length of the half pipe, &emsp;back and forth, &emsp;until &emsp;she gained enough momentum to hoist herself onto the shelf of the ramp turned and looked at me, expectantly, waiting for approval. &emsp;I nod to her.<br>
				&emsp;Her brother follows with a tennis ball, plays catch with himself against the skate ramp. Points out that my shoes are untied and then joins his sister on the slope; they watch me with their corn silk heads tilted to the side. I tilt and look too, one hand extended to see through the sun.<br><br>
 
				I have to go suddenly with haste. &emsp;With what I know about the wherewithall that walks in men. And women too.
